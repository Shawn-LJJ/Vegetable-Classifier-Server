# Vegetable Classifier Server

This project is part of my submission for DevOps And Automation For AI CA2 submission from Singapore Polytechnic AY23/24. 
This is the back-end part of the project, a front-end will be in the other repo called vegetable classifier website. 
This project make use of our Convolutional Neural Networks models built from our Deep Learning CA1 assignment (also in another repo) and deploy them onto the cloud. 
This project is meant to be in gitlab but I want to also showcase my work here in my own github account so that is why you will see files like ```.gitlab-ci.yml``` in this repo.
More information of this project can be found under the ```documentation.ipynb```.
